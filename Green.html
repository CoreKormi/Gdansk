            <div class="text">Green Gate is located at the main square next to the river. It was meant to be a place for royalty when they visited town, but the smell was bad, so it was never used for that, rather it was used for conferences and meetings. Today now it is used for housing the national museum of Gdansk. </div>

            <div class="text">There was a famous crane used in the Middle Ages near the river, which was operated by 4 wheels, just nearby the Green Gate. It could lift 1 ton in 11 meters high if it was used by 4 people and could lift 2 tons 26 meters with 8. Today now it houses Gdansk's National Maritime Museum.</div>
