        <div class="texttitle">World War 2 Museum</div>
        <div class="textpile">
            <div class="text">This is a quite new museum in Gdansk, opened only in 2008 going by the name Westerplatte museum, but got the name changed quickly to Second World War Museum. Interestingly, the exhibition only opened later in 2017. The building is found on 2.5 acres and has approximately 23 thousand square meter area. The building upstairs contains a library, conference rooms as well as a cofes and restaurant with a great view.</div>

        <div class="textpile">
            <img src="images/Museum 2.jpg" class="image black-border">
            <div class="text">As we go underground, we arrive at the exhibition, down there there is no internet connection. The places house a bunch of props such as weapons, clothes, vehicles and propagandas at a time, but it also has a lot of videos all throughout. Although as sad as this event has been for Poland, the museum is heavily biased towards the victims, not showing any of the suffering from the other sides.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="textpile">
            <div class="text">The place is divided up to individual rooms throughout the museum which go in detail with certain topics. These include the different parts of the war, from the different sides and their occupancy to the cities that were sieged, to the way they fought and weapons they had and many other aspects of the war.</div>

        <div class="textpile">
            <img src="images/Museum 4.jpg" class="image black-border">
            <div class="text">Final thing to mention is that these places have really been put effort into, the lighting and sounds at every room always emphasise something different, such as the communism one its propaganda, or this room with a tank showing the destroyed remains of the city. It is an interesting place to visit those who like history, the price of it is rather cheap, around at a 100 Krones.</div>
