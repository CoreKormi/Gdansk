            <div>The original one at first it was not only used as a theatre but also as a fencing school as well as a place for animal fights. It was located at the edges of the city as the church sometimes did not approve of the existence of the building. People often came here as the cheapest tickets were around the price of a beer.</div>

        <div class="textpile">
            <div class="text">The building was made from wood and had an open roof. It symmetrical on all sides, making it more visible for the audience, but also made it hard to use props as all of them would have to be used on all sides. Actors all around the world came here to perform here and the shows were frequently a mix of languages.</div>
