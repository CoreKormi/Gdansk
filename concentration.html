            <div class="text">Stutthof concentration camp was a place of death for everyone living near it, such were the people of Gdansk. It has been operating since the day the war started and only ended the day the Nazi’s fell. Through its long use 110 thousand people got captured from which 65 thousand got killed. Taking into account that it operated for roughly 2000 days, it meant on average they killed around 30 people every day.</div>

            <div class="text">Those who lived haven’t had it better either. People barely got food, had to wear the same clothes every day which first it was their own, later a stiped uniform. At first, they slept on the ground, later in rather uncomfortable and very crowded beds. They barely had time to sleep and the sleep they got was lacklustre.</div>

        <div class="textpile">
            <div class="text">There were many kinds of prisoners inside the camps, from Jews to people with disabilities or different sexual orientations to people who just despised the Nazi system. To differentiate them they used different types of collars, so the guards could threat them accordingly. Guards of this place also used to shoot down a few prisoners, as for the ones who were escaping, they got free days off.</div>

            <div class="text">In the camp there were different kinds of buildings, from bararcks to kitchens, to crematoriums. Some buildings were changed around to confuse the prisoners even more. Prisoners were sometimes transferred between camps, so they used a wagon as a chamber as well, to confuse the prisoners. Escaping was hardly likely, the place had a bunch of guards, barbed wire and was surrounded by natural boarders. The nearest city was 20 km away. Only 1 person escaped. </div>
