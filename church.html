            <div class="text">St. Mary’s Church is a Brick Gothic Catholic church which was also used as a Lutheran church. It is found at the middle of Gdansk and because of its immense size it was the world’s largest Lutheran church until 1945 as well as the second largest brick church in the world. It was built in 1502, but the construction has started since 1379 by architect Heinrich Ungeradin.</div>

The altar at the middle of the church is also decorated by many details and a golden cover. The church had to also endure the attack in World War two from which parts of the building remained, but the ceiling collapsed.

It contains a calendar, shows the zodiac signs as well as the current phase of the moon. At the noon of each day, it plays a small play of Adam and Eve.</div>
